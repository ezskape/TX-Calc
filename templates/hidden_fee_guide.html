            <h2>Why advertised rates are misleading in Texas</h2>
            <p>
              Many plans promote an eye-catching cents-per-kWh number that only applies at one usage tier.
              The real cost often includes additional delivery charges, base fees, and credits that shift the
              effective rate once your usage changes. Your bill is made up of two parts: the energy charge from
              your retail provider and the delivery charge from your local Transmission and Distribution Utility
              (TDU). TDUs apply both a per-kWh delivery rate and a fixed monthly delivery charge that every customer
              pays.

            <h2>Common hidden fees</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>The &quot;Teaser Rate&quot; trap:</strong> the bold advertised rate (like 11.5¢/kWh) often applies only
                at exactly 1,000 kWh. The &quot;average rate&quot; is a calculation, not a flat price—use 999 or 1,001 kWh and
                your rate can jump when you miss a usage credit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Minimum usage penalty:</strong> the most common hidden fee for energy-efficient homes or small
                apartments. Look for EFL language like &quot;Minimum Usage Fee: $9.95 if usage is below 1,000 kWh.&quot;
                You are literally being penalized for saving energy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Base charges (subscription fees):</strong> a fixed $5–$15 monthly fee just for having the account.
                If you use less power (a condo or guest house), a $10 base charge can add ~2¢ per kWh to your
                effective rate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bill credits with thresholds:</strong> discounts that vanish if you miss a usage band, which can
                make your rate jump even if your usage changes by a few kWh.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Time-of-use fine print:</strong> free nights or weekends paired with higher daytime rates that
                erase the advertised savings if your usage timing does not match the plan.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>TDU pass-through vs. bundled charges:</strong> if a rate looks too good to be true (like 6¢),
                it may exclude TDU delivery fees, which often add another 4–5¢ per kWh.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <article class="value-card" style="text-align: left;">
            <h2>The &quot;Contract Detective&quot; checklist</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Early Termination Fee:</strong> is it a flat $150 or $20 per month remaining?</li>
              <li><strong>Automatic Renewal:</strong> does the rate convert to a market rate after the contract ends?</li>
              <li><strong>Document Fee:</strong> are you paying $2/month just to receive a paper bill?</li>
              <li><strong>Separate charges:</strong> confirm the energy rate and TDU delivery rate are both listed.</li>
              <li><strong>Base charges:</strong> add fixed fees to your expected monthly total.</li>
              <li><strong>Bill credits:</strong> verify you will hit the usage threshold that unlocks them.</li>
              <li><strong>Effective rate:</strong> compare the total at your real kWh usage, not the advertised number.</li>
            </ol>
